I am a Junior Year Undergraduate student from [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), majoring in Quantitative Finance and double majoring in Mathematics. My research interest lies in operations research, especially in stochastic control, bandit, data-driven decision making, and dynamic programming.

I am very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Kuo (incoming summer research) and Prof. Wang (full year research).

You can find my [CV](https://felixjingyanzhang.github.io/Felix/assets/Zhang_Jingyan_CV.pdf) here. (Not yet cuz i don't know how to create a hyperlink in github right now.)
