I am a Junior Year Undergraduate student from [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), majoring in Quantitative Finance and double majoring in Mathematics. My research interest lies in operations research, especially in stochastic control, bandit, data-driven decision making, and dynamic programming.

I started my university journey with Architecture in my first year, then shifted to Economics and Finance in my second. But that first year was tough—the unfamiliar surroundings and my struggle to connect with the architecture program made it clear it wasn’t my calling. So, I looked to the business school for something different. In my second year, I sampled a variety of majors, only to find that economics and finance at the undergrad level didn’t spark any excitement in me. That’s when I pivoted to a more analytical, science-driven business track, diving into math and statistics—subjects that pushed me and made my college experience feel alive.
In the end, I landed on Quantitative Finance. It wasn’t just a practical choice; it opened doors to explore all sorts of topics. And along the way, I stumbled into Operations Research—a field that blends disciplines in ways I hadn’t expected. I’ve always been a perfectionist, and there’s something about chasing the best possible solution that hooked me. It’s become a quiet obsession of mine.

I am very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Kuo (incoming summer research) and Prof. Wang (full year research) started from my junior year.

You can find my CV here. (Not yet cuz i don't know how to create a hyperlink in github right now.)
