I am a Junior Year Undergraduate student from [HKU](https://www.hku.hk/). My research interest lies in operations research, especially in stochastic control, bandit, data-driven decision making and dynamic programming.

I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Kuo](https://sites.google.com/site/yonghongkuo/) and [Prof. Wang](http://zhengliwang.net/) in HKU.

You can find my [CV](/assets/Zhang_Jingyan_CV.pdf) here.
